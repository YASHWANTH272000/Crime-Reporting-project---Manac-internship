	<h4>&emsp; &emsp;Our aim by using this project is to develop an Online crime reporting system. This system is easily accessible by all normal public, the public department and the administrative department .
	
	<br>&emsp; &emsp;
This system is developed because the normal public is afraid to report a complaint against any crime going around them. so by using this system the normal public can easily report a complaint against any dangerous criminals to their respective police station.

	<br>&emsp; &emsp;
This police station share information with different police stations, which help them in catching criminals keeping records of all criminals will help police to keep tab on criminal to perform legal activities.

	<br>&emsp; &emsp;
By using this system, the record work is reduced and the data stored in computer is more confidential then a paper work.

	<br>&emsp; &emsp;
The other advantages on this is people can view the status of complaints and most wanted criminals images.

	<br>&emsp; &emsp;
Form the whole, this method helps to bring general public and police department close to each other to share their views and it also reduce criminal activities. </h2>
